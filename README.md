## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It has been long time since i used psudo selectors to select the elements i needed. So, i used them to setup the border-radious for the first and last element.

### Continued development

I do have a gut feeling the code can be optimized to be more consise, so i will try to figure out a way to acive the same design with less code.
